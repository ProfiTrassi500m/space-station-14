  description: Due to its small size, it is not very convenient for shooting (which is not so important when used for self-defense). The small handle does not provide support for the little finger, which negatively affects shooting accuracy. But when using magazines with a capacity of 10 rounds, which have a cover with a protruding front part for resting the little finger, the retention becomes more stable.
